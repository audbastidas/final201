                        <p>I specialize in oncology esthetics, helping cancer patients strengthen their skin barrier while undergoing chemo treatments and radiation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As an esthetician, I specialize in enhancing skin health and beauty through a variety of treatments and techniques. My services include facials, skin assessments, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion, tailored to meet the unique needs of each client's skin.
                             I am skilled in analyzing skin types and conditions, and I provide personalized skincare advice and routines to help clients achieve a radiant complexion.
                              My expertise also extends to applying makeup, performing waxing services, and offering guidance on products that best suit individual skin concerns. 
                              Passionate about skincare, I strive to provide relaxing and therapeutic experiences that promote overall well-being and confidence.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Services</h2>
                        <p>Here's a short description of some of the services you offer as an esthetician: </p>
                            <br>

                           <p> Facials: Customized to each client's skin type and concerns, our facials promote relaxation and rejuvenation. Treatments may include deep cleansing, exfoliation, steam, and nourishing masks to restore a vibrant, healthy glow. </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <p>Chemical Peels: These treatments are designed to improve skin texture and tone, reducing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and discoloration. By carefully selecting the appropriate chemical solution, we help reveal smoother, fresher skin. </p>
                            <br>
                            
                           <p> Microdermabrasion: A non-invasive procedure that revitalizes dull skin, reduces large pores, erases fine lines and wrinkles, and treats acne scars. This service uses a minimally abrasive instrument to gently sand your skin, removing the thicker, uneven outer layer. </p>
                           <br>
                            
                           <p> Waxing: Offering a full range of waxing services, from eyebrows to legs, ensuring smooth skin with long-lasting results. Our gentle techniques minimize discomfort and promote skin health. </p>
                           <br>
                            
                            Skin Consultations: Tailored advice based on detailed skin analysis to help clients understand their skin type and how to care for it. 
                            Recommendations on skincare products and routines are provided to maintain and enhance the skin's natural beauty.</p>

                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p> !-->

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
